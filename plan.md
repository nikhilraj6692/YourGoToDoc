  - Mobile breakpoint: 768px
  - Tablet breakpoint: 1024px
  - Use flex and grid layouts consistently

### Loading States
- Every API call must have appropriate loading states
- Loading states should be granular and specific to the action being performed
- Loading indicators should be visible and provide clear feedback to users
- Loading states should be managed independently for different sections/components
- Loading states should be cleared in both success and error cases (use try/finally)

### Form Handling
- Track form dirty state to prevent unnecessary API calls
- Compare current form values with previous values before making API calls
- Clear form state when switching between different sections/tabs
- Maintain separate state objects for different forms/sections
- Implement proper validation before making API calls
- Show appropriate error messages for invalid inputs

### API Call Best Practices
- Implement request debouncing for search inputs
- Cache API responses when appropriate
- Handle API errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed API calls
- Clear previous results when starting new searches
- Maintain separate loading states for different API calls

### UI/UX Guidelines
- Show loading spinners for all async operations
- Disable buttons/inputs during loading states
- Provide clear feedback for all user actions
- Maintain consistent loading UI across the application
- Use appropriate loading indicators based on the action type
- Show progress indicators for long-running operations

### State Management
- Keep state as local as possible
- Use separate state objects for different features
- Clear state when switching between features
- Implement proper state cleanup in useEffect
- Track previous values to prevent unnecessary updates
- Use proper state initialization

### Error Handling
- Show user-friendly error messages
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Handle network errors gracefully
- Provide retry options for failed operations
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Clear error states when starting new operations

### Performance Considerations
- Implement proper memoization
- Use appropriate loading states to prevent UI freezes
- Optimize API calls to prevent unnecessary requests
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Use pagination for large data sets
- Implement proper cleanup for subscriptions and listeners

# Design Consistency Plan

## Prerequisites
- All CSS styles must be defined in CSS files, not inline in components
- Use `className` instead of inline styles
- Keep styles organized in component-specific CSS files
- Follow BEM naming convention for CSS classes
- Use CSS variables for consistent values

## Border Radius Standardization
- Standardize all border-radius values to 7px across the application for consistency
- This includes but not limited to:
  - Cards
  - Buttons
  - Input fields
  - Dropdowns
  - Modals
  - Avatars
  - Badges
  - Any other UI elements with rounded corners

### Current Implementation
- Doctor info section: 7px border-radius ✅
- Other components: Need to be updated

### Components to Update
1. Doctor cards
2. Search forms
3. Buttons
4. Input fields
5. Dropdowns
6. Modals
7. Avatars
8. Badges
9. Loading indicators
10. Error/success messages

### Benefits
- Consistent visual language across the application
- More professional and polished look
- Better alignment with modern UI design principles
- Improved user experience through visual consistency

### Implementation Notes
- Use CSS variables for border-radius to maintain consistency
- Consider creating a design system or style guide
- Document the standard in the project's style guide

## Future Improvements
### Pagination Enhancements
- Implement bi-directional infinite scroll (hasPrevious)
- Add ability to scroll up to load previous pages

- Remove old records from memory when they're far from the current view
- Cache recently viewed records for quick access
- Implement cleanup of unused records to prevent memory leaks

## Current Implementation
- Doctor info section: 7px border-radius ✅
- Other components: Need to be updated 

# CSS Selector Prefixing Plan

## Issues Found

### 1. Schedule.css - Missing Container Prefixes
The following selectors in `mediconnect-ui/src/pages/doctor-dashboard/Schedule.css` need to be prefixed with `.schedule-container`:

**Unprefixed Selectors Found:**
- `.current-month` (line 35)
- `.header-actions` (line 47)
- `.calendar-container` (line 55)
- `.calendar-grid` (line 67)
- `.calendar-header-cell` (line 75)
- `.calendar-cell` (line 87)
- `.day-header` (line 147)
- `.add-slots-btn` (line 165)
- `.time-slots` (line 195)
- `.time-slot` (line 258)
- `.schedule-legend` (line 300)
- `.legend-item` (line 312)
- `.legend-color` (line 330)
- `.schedule-loading` (line 358)
- `.loading-container` (line 371)
- `.loading-spinner` (line 380)
- `.custom-datepicker` (line 437)
- `.custom-select` (line 463)
- `.custom-range` (line 496)
- `.custom-time-input` (line 538)
- `.repeat-group` (line 563)
- `.repeat-days-group` (line 612)
- `.repeat-days-checkboxes` (line 628)
- `.modal-actions` (line 691)
- `.confirm-btn` (line 712)
- `.extension-options` (line 733)
- `.custom-input` (line 782)
- `.calendar-navigation` (line 805)
- `.nav-btn` (line 813)
- `.nav-btn-alt` (line 857)
- `.slot-info` (line 905)
- `.custom-datepicker-popper` (line 918)
- `.react-datepicker-popper` (line 922)
- `.react-datepicker` (line 935)
- `.time-inputs` (line 1053)
- `.slot-preview` (line 1068)
- `.warning-modal` (line 1098)
- `.warning-content` (line 1114)
- `.warning-icon` (line 1120)
- `.warning-body` (line 1125)
- `.warning-title` (line 1129)
- `.warning-description` (line 1136)
- `.warning-subtitle` (line 1144)
- `.warning-list` (line 1151)
- `.warning-actions` (line 1163)
- `.schedule-container-wrapper` (line 1407)
- `.stats-display` (line 1416)
- `.header-buttons` (line 1425)
- `.delete-slots-btn` (line 1430)

**Action Required:** Prefix all these selectors with `.schedule-container` to prevent cross-component CSS conflicts.

## General Rule
All CSS selectors in component-specific CSS files must be prefixed with their respective container class:
- Patient dashboard files: `.profile-page`, `.dashboard-home`, `.settings-page`, `.billing-page`, `.find-doctor-container`
- Doctor dashboard files: `.schedule-container`, `.doctor-dashboard-container`
- Component files: `.booking-modal`, etc.

## Benefits
- Prevents CSS conflicts between components
- Improves maintainability
- Makes debugging easier
- Follows CSS scoping best practices
