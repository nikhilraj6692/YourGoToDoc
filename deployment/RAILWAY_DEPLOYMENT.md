# MediConnect Railway Deployment Guide

## üöÇ Railway Overview

Railway is a modern deployment platform that makes it easy to deploy full-stack applications. It provides:
- **Automatic deployments** from Git
- **Built-in databases** (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)
- **Environment variables** management
- **Custom domains** with SSL
- **Scaling** capabilities
- **Vault integration** for secrets management

## üóùÔ∏è Vault Integration

Railway provides built-in Vault functionality for secure secrets management:

### Setting up Vault in Railway
1. **Go to your Railway project**
2. **Navigate to Variables tab**
3. **Add your secrets** as environment variables
4. **Railway automatically encrypts** and stores them securely

### Vault Best Practices
- ‚úÖ **Never commit secrets** to version control
- ‚úÖ **Use Railway's Variables** for all sensitive data
- ‚úÖ **Rotate secrets** regularly
- ‚úÖ **Use different values** for dev/staging/prod
- ‚úÖ **Limit access** to production secrets

## üöÄ Quick Deployment

### Step 1: Install Railway CLI
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login
```

### Step 2: Initialize Railway Project
```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd MediConnect

# Initialize Railway project
railway init

# Link to existing project (if you created one in Railway dashboard)
railway link
```

### Step 3: Set up Environment Variables (Vault)
```bash
# Set environment variables using Railway CLI
railway variables set MONGODB_URI="your-mongodb-connection-string"
railway variables set JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-jwt-key"
railway variables set S3_BUCKET_NAME="your-s3-bucket"
railway variables set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-aws-access-key"
railway variables set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-aws-secret-key"
railway variables set CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://your-domain.railway.app"
railway variables set REACT_APP_API_URL="https://your-backend.railway.app/api"
railway variables set REACT_APP_WS_URL="wss://your-backend.railway.app/ws"
```

### Step 4: Deploy Backend
```bash
# Deploy backend service
railway up

# Check deployment status
railway status

# View logs
railway logs
```

### Step 5: Deploy Frontend
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd mediconnect-ui

# Deploy frontend service

2. **Set up Railway project**
3. **Configure Railway variables**
4. **Deploy application**
5. **Update DNS** to point to Railway
6. **Test thoroughly**
7. **Decommission AWS resources**

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Set up Railway account** and install CLI
2. **Create Railway project** and link repository
3. **Configure environment variables** (Vault)
4. **Deploy backend** and test
5. **Deploy frontend** and test
6. **Configure custom domain** (optional)
7. **Set up monitoring** and alerts
8. **Document deployment process**
