### Loading States
- Every API call must have appropriate loading states
- Loading states should be granular and specific to the action being performed
- Loading indicators should be visible and provide clear feedback to users
- Loading states should be managed independently for different sections/components
- Loading states should be cleared in both success and error cases (use try/finally)

### Form Handling
- Track form dirty state to prevent unnecessary API calls
- Compare current form values with previous values before making API calls
- Clear form state when switching between different sections/tabs
- Maintain separate state objects for different forms/sections
- Implement proper validation before making API calls
- Show appropriate error messages for invalid inputs

### API Call Best Practices
- Implement request debouncing for search inputs
- Cache API responses when appropriate
- Handle API errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed API calls
- Clear previous results when starting new searches
- Maintain separate loading states for different API calls

### UI/UX Guidelines
- Show loading spinners for all async operations
- Disable buttons/inputs during loading states
- Provide clear feedback for all user actions
- Maintain consistent loading UI across the application
- Use appropriate loading indicators based on the action type
- Show progress indicators for long-running operations

### State Management
- Keep state as local as possible
- Use separate state objects for different features
- Clear state when switching between features
- Implement proper state cleanup in useEffect
- Track previous values to prevent unnecessary updates
- Use proper state initialization

### Error Handling
- Show user-friendly error messages
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Handle network errors gracefully

- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Clear error states when starting new operations

### Performance Considerations

# Design Consistency Plan

## Prerequisites
- All CSS styles must be defined in CSS files, not inline in components
- Use `className` instead of inline styles
- Keep styles organized in component-specific CSS files
- Follow BEM naming convention for CSS classes
- Use CSS variables for consistent values

## Border Radius Standardization
- Standardize all border-radius values to 7px across the application for consistency
- This includes but not limited to:
  - Cards
  - Buttons
  - Input fields
  - Dropdowns
  - Modals
  - Avatars
  - Badges
  - Any other UI elements with rounded corners

### Current Implementation
- Doctor info section: 7px border-radius ✅
- Other components: Need to be updated

### Components to Update
1. Doctor cards
2. Search forms
3. Buttons
4. Input fields
5. Dropdowns
6. Modals
7. Avatars
8. Badges
9. Loading indicators
10. Error/success messages

### Benefits
- Consistent visual language across the application
- More professional and polished look
- Better alignment with modern UI design principles
- Improved user experience through visual consistency

### Implementation Notes
- Use CSS variables for border-radius to maintain consistency
- Consider creating a design system or style guide
- Document the standard in the project's style guide

## Future Improvements

- Cache recently viewed records for quick access
- Implement cleanup of unused records to prevent memory leaks

## Current Implementation
- Doctor info section: 7px border-radius ✅
- Other components: Need to be updated
