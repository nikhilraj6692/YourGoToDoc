# MediConnect Development Plan

## Development Prerequisites and Best Practices

### CSS Theming Guidelines
- Use consistent color scheme across all components
  - Primary color: #86bf23 (green)
  - Border color: #e2e8f0
  - Focus state: rgba(134, 191, 35, 0.1)
- Maintain consistent styling for form elements
  - Border width: 2px
  - Border radius: 0.5rem
  - Padding: 0.875rem 1rem
  - Font size: 1rem
- Implement consistent focus states
  - Border color: #86bf23
  - Box shadow: 0 0 0 3px rgba(134, 191, 35, 0.1)
- Use consistent hover effects
  - Background color: #f7fafc
  - Text color: #86bf23
- Maintain consistent spacing
  - Gap between elements: 1rem
  - Margin between sections: 2rem
- Follow responsive design patterns
  - Mobile breakpoint: 768px
  - Tablet breakpoint: 1024px
  - Use flex and grid layouts consistently

### Loading States
- Every API call must have appropriate loading states
- Loading states should be granular and specific to the action being performed
- Loading indicators should be visible and provide clear feedback to users
- Loading states should be managed independently for different sections/components
- Loading states should be cleared in both success and error cases (use try/finally)

### Form Handling
- Track form dirty state to prevent unnecessary API calls
- Compare current form values with previous values before making API calls
- Clear form state when switching between different sections/tabs
- Maintain separate state objects for different forms/sections
- Implement proper validation before making API calls
- Show appropriate error messages for invalid inputs

### API Call Best Practices
- Implement request debouncing for search inputs
- Cache API responses when appropriate
- Handle API errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed API calls
- Clear previous results when starting new searches
- Maintain separate loading states for different API calls

### UI/UX Guidelines
- Show loading spinners for all async operations
- Disable buttons/inputs during loading states
- Provide clear feedback for all user actions
- Maintain consistent loading UI across the application
- Use appropriate loading indicators based on the action type
- Show progress indicators for long-running operations

### State Management
- Keep state as local as possible
- Use separate state objects for different features
- Clear state when switching between features
- Implement proper state cleanup in useEffect
- Track previous values to prevent unnecessary updates
- Use proper state initialization

### Error Handling
- Show user-friendly error messages
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Handle network errors gracefully
- Provide retry options for failed operations
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Clear error states when starting new operations

### Performance Considerations
- Implement proper memoization
- Use appropriate loading states to prevent UI freezes
- Optimize API calls to prevent unnecessary requests
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Use pagination for large data sets
- Implement proper cleanup for subscriptions and listeners
